## 1. Process topology

Three processes, one datastore:

```
agent session (Claude Code / Cursor)
   │ stdio (MCP protocol)
   ▼
apps/mcp/mcp-server.py        ← 30 MCP tools; a THIN HTTP client. No SQLite
   │ HTTP, localhost             fallback: if the daemon is down it returns a
   ▼                             loud structured error, never stale data.
apps/daemon/engine_daemon.py  ← FastAPI daemon, default bind 127.0.0.1:8786.
   │                             Holds the embedding model in RAM; owns ALL
   ▼                             DB writes and background loops.
db/engine.db                  ← SQLite in WAL mode. Single file, plus
                                 sidecar state DBs for capture + token events.
```

- **Console entry points** (`pyproject.toml [project.scripts]`): `crag-anchor`
  (daemon), `crag-anchor-mcp` (MCP server), `crag-anchor-cli` (operator
  lifecycle tooling: migrate / backfill / decay). The `crag_anchor/` package
  contains thin runpy shims that execute the single-file app scripts from the
  checkout.
- **Path/bind resolution** (`db/engine_paths.py`): every path and the daemon
  bind resolve as *env var → `db/stack.toml` → repo-relative default*. Env
  always wins; deleting `stack.toml` breaks nothing.
- **Migrations** (`db/migrations/*.sql`, applied by `crag-anchor-cli migrate`
  and auto-applied by the daemon on boot against an empty DB): numbered,
  append-only, idempotent (version-checked against `schema_version`).

## 2. Memory model

Two trust layers plus a claims substrate:

| Layer | Table | Trust semantics |
|---|---|---|
| **Insights** | `insights` | Raw memories (gotchas, patterns, decisions). Confidence starts ~0.5, moves with `verify` (+0.1 / -0.2), decays when unused. |
| **Principles** | `principles` | Distilled, high-trust rules. Seeded at 0.9 by promotion; gentler verify deltas (+0.05 / -0.1). Loaded first at session pre-flight; they override conflicting raw insights. |
| **Claims** | `claims` + `insight_claims` / `principle_claims` | Atomic, testable decompositions of the above — the verification substrate (§4). |

Auto-promotion: the daemon promotes an insight to a principle when confidence
≥ 0.85 with ≥ 3 verifies and a positive streak (see the lifecycle loops in
`engine_daemon.py`). Weekly decay lowers confidence of unrecalled insights.

**Entity graph** (`db/entity_extract.py`, `db/entity_normalize.py`, migration
027): every save extracts typed entities (port, ip, domain, path, service,
file, classname, env_var), normalizes them into canonical rows
(`entity_canonical`) with typed relations (`entity_relations`). The `graph`
MCP tool traverses it: `siblings` (claims sharing entities), `neighbors` (one
entity's relations), `impact` (1-hop blast radius of an entity change).

## 3. Recall path

`POST /recall` (daemon) → hybrid ranking: cosine similarity over
all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings (via fastembed/onnxruntime, model cached in
`model-cache/`) + BM25 full-text + confidence weighting. Matching principles
ride along with insight hits.

Every hit carries a **liveness block**: `fresh | aging | unverified |
revalidating | stale`, derived from when the claim was last grounded vs its
volatility TTL. Agents are expected to discount `stale`/`revalidating` hits.
Recall of an aging/stale hit *enqueues a grounding job* for it
(recall-as-trigger): hot memories stay verified because using them re-tests
them.

## 4. Claim layer (`db/claim_layer.py`)

An insight is a narrative; verification runs on atoms. The post-save async
pipeline:

1. **Decompose** — LLM role `decompose` splits the text into atomic claim
   drafts (fail-soft: on failure, one summary claim).
2. **Classify** — rules first, LLM (`classify`) last, into a **closed P1–P5
   taxonomy**:
   - **P1 mechanical** — read-only shell check `{cmd, expect}`
   - **P2 documentary** — source anchor `{file, load-bearing substrings}`
   - **P3 temporal** — event assertion vs local ground truth
   - **P4 semantic** — evidence-bundle recipe `{sources[], question}` → LLM verdict
   - **P5 axiomatic** — preference/decision/history; terminal, never queued
3. **Author** — for P1/P4, an LLM (`author`) writes the executable predicate
   spec. P1 commands are validated against the same read-only guard the
   executor enforces.
4. **Canonicalize + link** — claims are hashed, deduped into a shared pool,
   and linked to their parent insight/principle.

Rollup: parent claim-health is computed from its linked claims' verdicts —
a principle whose claims roll up fresh is *compile-eligible* for
`crag distill` (`/principles/export`, `principles_export` behavior tested in
`apps/daemon/tests/test_principles_export_drain.py`).

Routing isolation (`assert_no_interactive_proxy`): background LLM roles must
never ride an interactive session's local proxy; they use the configured
provider directly (§7).

## 5. Grounding (v2 queue + v3 adjudication)

- **Queue** (`db/grounding_queue_v2.py`, `grounding_jobs` table): durable,
  deduplicated jobs (`enqueue_job` is INSERT OR IGNORE on pending). Fed by
  recall-as-trigger (hot claims) and a periodic sweep (cold claims past their
  volatility TTL).
- **Workers**: an in-daemon async pool drains jobs — runs the falsifier steps
  **read-only** (a forbidden-command guard is enforced at authoring time and
  again at execution, defence-in-depth), gathers evidence, and for P4 claims
  asks an LLM (`verdict`, escalating to `adjudicate` on hard cases) to judge.
- **History** (`grounding_history`): every job leaves a full reasoning trail —
  commands run, evidence, verdict, chain-of-thought, recipe version. Surfaced
  via `grounding(action="history"|"jobs"|"stats")`.
- **Doctrine: detection ≠ resolution.** Grounding *flags* drift; it never
  auto-demotes. Resolution (verify / update / supersede / clear) is the
  agent's or operator's job via the `audit` → `grounding(check)` → `clear`
  triage loop. Autoresolve exists only for narrow, safe cases
  (`db/grounding_resolve.py`, tested in `test_grounding_autoresolve.py`).
- **Budget guard** (`db/grounding_cost.py`, migration 030): daily call/token
  budgets, min-interval pacing, optional pause-on-budget — grounding can never
  starve the interactive session's quota.

## 6. Write path & disposition

- **Write gate** (`db/write_gate.py`): every save passes hard gates — schema
  validation, a live-credential secret scan (AWS keys, PATs, private keys...)
  — then lifecycle resolution (new / update / supersede / noop against
  near-duplicates). Non-clean writes route to `insights_staging`, not the
  corpus.
- **Capture pipeline** (`db/capture/`): an autonomic tailer reads agent
  transcript files (watermark + rate-limit + dedup state in
  `capture-state.db`), an extractor LLM (`extract` role) mines candidate
  lessons, and `emit.py` posts them to `POST /capture/event` (optional
  shared-secret token auth). Everything lands in staging — **capture never
  writes the corpus directly**.
- **Disposition engine** (`db/disposition.py`, migrations 031–033): every
  staging row is a proposed state transition with a policy tier:
  - **T0 auto** — clean provenance, executes automatically, logged.
  - **T1 agent-delegable** — needs session capability `granted`.
  - **T2 human** — secret-flagged / high-impact; only `human_approved` may
    accept. An agent alone gets `requires_human`.
  A drain-SLA sweep ages every entry toward a terminal-or-safe outcome
  (T1/T2 default to `defer`, never blind auto-accept).
- **Contradiction handling** (`db/contradiction.py`, `db/claim_contradiction.py`):
  new claims/insights are cross-checked against neighbors (cosine + entailment
  heuristics); suspects land in an audit queue. False positives are cleared
  (`clear_suspect`), true conflicts adjudicated (`arena`) with supersede
  provenance. The detector is deliberately high-recall / low-precision;
  triage is explicit.

## 7. LLM provider seam (`db/llm_client.py`, `db/grounding_config.py`)

One provider abstraction, four backends, selected by config only:

| Provider | Auth | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `anthropic-oauth` (default) | local Claude Code OAuth token | zero-config local mode; bills the subscription, guarded by budgets |
| `anthropic-api` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | server/team mode, metered |
| `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI-compatible endpoints |
| `ollama-local` | none | local models, zero marginal cost |

Per-role model selection (`[models]` in `db/stack.toml`): cheap tier for
decompose/classify/author/extract, stronger tier for verdict/adjudicate.
Fail-open: any client error returns `None` and the caller degrades gracefully.

## 8. Observability & self-description

- `GET /health` — daemon health + model state.
- `GET /metrics` — Prometheus text (`crag_anchor_*` counters/gauges).
- `GET /guide`, `GET /llms.txt` — machine-readable surface docs
  (`db/capabilities.py`); also exposed as the `engine_guide` MCP tool and the
  `engine://guide` MCP resource.
- Token ledger (`token_ledger` table, `cost_report`/`add_token_record` tools):
  per-session token cost plus empirical memory-value counters (recall hits
  that changed the approach, repeated errors already covered by a saved
  insight, novel saves).

## 9. Overlay modules (`crag_anchor.modules`)

A private or superset deployment can extend the daemon with extra routes and
console modules WITHOUT forking or editing the engine. The public daemon
discovers overlay modules at startup (after the core routes mount) and mounts
each one fail-soft. This is the dependency-inversion seam: the private
`crag-engine-ops` repo pip-installs `crag-anchor` and ships its `ops_infra`
overlay instead of maintaining a daemon fork.

**Two discovery channels** (unioned; an overlay listed in both loads once):

| Channel | Source | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Entry points | group `crag_anchor.modules` in the overlay's `pyproject.toml` | pip-installed overlays |
| Env var | `CRAG_ANCHOR_MODULES` — comma-separated importable module names | dev/checkout overlays that are not pip-installed themselves |

**Module protocol** (all parts optional — match what your overlay needs; this is
the same shape the core `aggregates`/`session_lifecycle` modules already use, so
no new contract is invented):

- `bind(**kwargs)` — dependency injection, called once at load. The daemon
  passes, by keyword, whichever of `get_db`, `table_exists`, `aggregates`,
  `claim_layer` your signature declares (introspected; a `**kwargs` signature
  receives all of them). Omit `bind` entirely if you need no daemon internals.
- `register(aggregates)` — called with the `aggregates` module so the overlay
  can idempotently append its module dict to `aggregates.CORE_MODULES`, which is
  what `GET /console/modules` returns. This is how an overlay's nav module shows
  up in the console manifest alongside the core modules.
- `router` — an `APIRouter`; if present it is mounted via
  `app.include_router(router)`, adding the overlay's HTTP routes.

**Fail-soft contract:** discovery is per-module isolated. A module that raises
during load logs a single `ERROR` line (`overlay module '<name>' failed to load
— SKIPPED: <exc>`) and is skipped; the daemon still boots and sibling overlays
are unaffected. With no overlays present the behavior is byte-for-byte the core
engine (the manifest returns only the core modules).

## 10. Testing

Test suites are standalone scripts (no pytest dependency): each file under
`apps/daemon/tests/`, `apps/mcp/tests/`, `db/tests/` builds a temp DB from the
real migrations, exercises the target module directly, and exits 0/1. Run any
of them with plain `python <file>`. `scripts/test-timestamp-convention.py` is a
repo-wide gate: all TEXT timestamps must be written by Python UTC ISO-8601
(never SQLite `datetime('now')`) because mixing the two formats corrupts
lexical ordering.
